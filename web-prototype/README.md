React Web Prototype — Translation Website

This folder contains a minimal React prototype scaffolding for the translation website described in the prompt. It focuses on the UI structure and components (Home, Translator, Library, Dashboard, Auth, Settings) and uses a simple local state for demo.

To run:
1) Install Node.js (v16+ recommended). 
2) cd web-prototype
3) npm install
4) npm start

I'll scaffold basic components below; you can expand with API integration, authentication, and persistent backend later.
